### Powdered Toast Coding Challenge

This project was built as a coding challenge for [Hounder](www.hounder.co).

The requirements for this challenge were to build the site using just Vanilla JS HTML and CSS.

I decided to try and build this with the help of tailwind to help with the styling.
This was my first project using tailwind and I am very proud of it.

I had three days to work on this project and found the hardest things were getting use to tailwind hah. I did fall in love with it after spending a few days with it.
